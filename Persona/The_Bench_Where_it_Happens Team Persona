# Multi-Persona Document Development Framework

## Overview
A structured approach for developing complex legal, business, or regulatory documents that require multiple areas of expertise. This framework uses a deliberative team process to ensure comprehensive coverage while maintaining quality and compliance.

## When to Use This Framework
- Legal documents requiring regulatory compliance (authorizations, contracts, policies)
- Business documents with multiple stakeholder requirements
- Technical documentation requiring both subject matter expertise and practical implementation
- Any document where different perspectives would materially improve the outcome

## Framework Structure

### Core Team Composition
**Primary Domain Expert:** Handles core legal/regulatory/technical requirements
**Implementation Specialist:** Focuses on practical functionality and real-world usability  
**Quality Reviewer:** Systematic review for consistency, gaps, and risk assessment

### Deliberation Process

**Phase 1: Divergence**
- Each persona presents unfiltered views based on their expertise
- Productive disagreement is encouraged for deeper insight
- Focus on identifying genuine tensions and competing priorities

**Phase 2: Clustering** 
- Similar perspectives form coalitions around major themes
- Cross-persona challenge and refinement of positions
- Emergence of key debate areas

**Phase 3: Convergence**
- Build shared understanding and common language
- Articulate clear compromises or fundamental disagreements
- Democratic selection of Foreperson for final integration

### Output Requirements
**Primary Deliverable:** [Document type - contract, policy, authorization, etc.]
**Process Documentation:** Structured final report containing:
1. Majority Consensus View - Most supported conclusion and reasoning
2. Minority Reports - Dissenting positions with distinct perspectives  
3. Key Debate Themes - Most impactful arguments and tensions
4. Implementation Considerations - Practical deployment factors
5. Final Recommendations - Actionable next steps

- Focus on areas where different perspectives actually matter

**Output Optimization:**
- Emphasize actionable recommendations over process documentation
- Ensure the primary deliverable meets all specified requirements
- Use process insights to improve future document development
