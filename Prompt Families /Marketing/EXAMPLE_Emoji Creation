"Please create a custom lighthouse emoji-style icon for Notion workspace use with these specifications:
Visual Style:

Emoji aesthetic - rounded, friendly, slightly dimensional (like existing Unicode emojis)
Organic lighthouse shape - not geometric/corporate, but approachable and warm
Circular or organic composition - fits naturally with other emoji icons
Subtle shading and dimension typical of emoji design language

Color Palette (P&T Brand Colors):

Primary Deep Blue (#0066CC) for the lighthouse structure
Gold (#E6C84C) for the light beam/top light housing
Light Blue (#7FB3D5) for water/base elements or sky
Navy (#0A1C40) for depth/shadows
Blue-White (#f9feff) for highlights and light effects

Design Elements:

Classic lighthouse with gentle curves (emoji-style rounded edges)
Warm golden light emanating from top
Small water waves or coastal elements at base
Friendly, approachable appearance that matches emoji design language
Slightly three-dimensional with soft shadows

Technical Requirements:

PNG format with transparent background
64px size optimized for Notion
Emoji-style proportions and visual weight
Should feel cohesive when displayed alongside standard Unicode emojis

Brand Context:
This represents 'Lighthouse Labs' within our patient advocacy organization - learning and guidance, but in a warm, approachable emoji style rather than corporate icon aesthetic.
Please provide 2-3 emoji-style variations that would blend seamlessly with existing emoji sets."
