## **Quality Assurance Notes**

### **For Mixed Voice Content:**
Evaluate each section according to its intended voice type. Overall score should reflect whether the voice mixing is intentional and effective or inconsistent and problematic.

### **Context Considerations:**
- **Crisis Communications**: May warrant different emotional calibration standards
- **Social Media**: May require adaptation of accessibility standards for platform
- **Professional Presentations**: May emphasize evidence and credibility more heavily

### **Scoring Consistency:**
AI evaluators should err toward conservative scoring. When uncertain between two scores, choose the lower score and provide specific improvement recommendations.

### **Publication Threshold:**
The 8.0+ standard ensures that P&T maintains high-quality, consistent brand representation across all communications while allowing room for continuous improvement toward excellence.
