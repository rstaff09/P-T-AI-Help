🤖 AI Prompt to generate Review

Once you’ve filled in the details, use the following prompt in your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini):

⸻

You’re helping me write a short, authentic review for the following business or product. This review will be posted on [platform - ie: Google, Yelp, Facebook etc]

Use the responses below as the foundation. Reference any system, or project memory regarding my tone; format; word choice, or business context to make it more authentic, personal and accurate.

Tone: Sincere, clear, conversational, casual. Use any turns of phrase I am prone to using to simulate my tone and voice authentically.
Length: Under 200 words.
SEO: Include key business or product name once or twice, plus category (e.g., AI tool for founders, herbal shop in Oakland, etc.). Include optimized Hashtags as appropriate
Social Media Fit: Write it in a way that would feel at home and be more likely to go viral based on the platform algorithm for the platform designated above. (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Yelp or Google Reviews etc) 
✅ Goals: 
	•	Capture a real person’s experience, not a bullet-point summary
	•	Preserve emotional tone, warmth, and context—especially if the business helped during a hard time
	•	Write in a way that fits naturally on the platform (Google, Facebook, etc.)
	•	Keep it under 250 words (Google) or platform-appropriate length
        •	Provide a factual (do not add facts that you have not been explicitly provided) and useful review of the experience, product or environment that is being reviewed.

You may start with a hook (e.g., “I didn’t expect…” or “Here’s what surprised me…”) and end with a light nudge or suggestion for others. Avoid any common "AI Phrasing giveaways" and "forbidden words or phrases" that may be in your system or project prompts. Use parenthetical commas or other punctuation, avoid em-dashes completely.
